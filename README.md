Hamster Hotel
This is a singlw person project where I had to design a static website from a prototype that was made in Adobe XD
Peer Reviewed By: “The Website looks almost exactly like the prototype we were given. Responsiveness works and everything is placed in a way that makes sense for design. Navbar functions well, it’s just the tablet and smaller one that could use a little work LOL. My feedback would be for some of the areas to be made a little smaller so they can fit on mobile better, but overall a nice looking website!”
